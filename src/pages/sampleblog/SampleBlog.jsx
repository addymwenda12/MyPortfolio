              From a young age, I harbored a passion for technology, dreaming of becoming a software engineer. This aspiration took root in high school, where I excelled in computer science, earning an A in my national examinations. Determined to turn my dream into reality, I joined the ALX Software Engineering program, where I immersed myself in the world of coding. I started with C and Python, progressing to JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and Express.js, and developed a deep affinity for databases, particularly PostgreSQL.
